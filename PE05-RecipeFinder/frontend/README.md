# PE05 — Recipe Finder (CityU CS452)

A small React app that searches TheMealDB and lists recipes. This submission uses Create React App and meets the assignment requirements for PE05 (Option A: Basic UI).

## How to run (local)
1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm install`  (only needed the first time)
3. `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Files of interest
- `src/App.js` — main app logic and state
- `src/components/Search.js` — search form + quick buttons
- `src/components/RecipeList.js` — lists results
- `src/components/RecipeItem.js` — single recipe card
- `src/App.css` — simple styles

## Screenshots included (for submission)
1. Working app with search bar displayed.
2. Search results (example: `chicken`) showing recipe cards.
3. GitHub repo with frontend uploaded (showing `/frontend` folder).

## Data source
TheMealDB API — public free API for recipe data.

## Notes
- This is the basic UI required by the course (no server-side required).
- If you want to add a details page/modal, that can be added later.
